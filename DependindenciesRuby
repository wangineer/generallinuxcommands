Resolving dependencies...
Could not find compatible versions

Because html-proofer >= 5.0.0 depends on Ruby >= 3.1, < 4.0
  and Gemfile depends on html-proofer ~> 5.0,
  Ruby >= 3.1, < 4.0 is required.
So, because current Ruby version is = 3.0.2,
  version solving has failed.







===================================================
This below needs to be added at the start
Edit the Gemfile
  nano Gemfile

add below lines

gem 'nokogiri'
gem 'rack', '~> 2.2.4'
gem 'rspec'

modify the "gem "html-proofer", from 5.0 to 3.0

save and exit




bundle install  <<< This now works



now you can do below to have a local site
bundle exec jekyll serve      < this will offer it up at 127.0.0.1 on port 4000
you want this to be accessible remotely  so you need to add a host ip 0.0.0.0

#bundle exec jekyll server --host 0.0.0.0
